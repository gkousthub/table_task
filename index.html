            His main aspiration is to become the Pirate King and is searching for the One Piece, a legendary treasure left by the previous Pirate King named Gold Roger. His inspiration comes from a crew of other pirates who used to visit his island when he was a child, the captain of which was "Red-Haired" Shanks. During one of these pirate crew's visits, he accidentally ate the Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no mi), a type of Devil Fruit that made his body like rubber. The catch to having these powers is an inability to swim: all those who eat a Devil Fruit will drown if they fall into the ocean.</p></td>
